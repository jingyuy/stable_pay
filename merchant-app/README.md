This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This demo app is dependent on payment-api and wallet-api up and running.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
